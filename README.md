## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd face-recognition
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. To run the face recognition script on an image:
    ```bash
    python recognize_faces.py --image path/to/image.jpg
    ```
2. To run the face recognition script on a video:
    ```bash
    python recognize_faces.py --video path/to/video.mp4
    ```
